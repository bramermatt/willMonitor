        <h2>Chapter 1 | The Scroll</h2>

        <blockquote>I might change this 'The Scroll' to Nickel Creek, but maybe not.</blockquote>

        <p>If you're reading this.. I am dead. No, not really, well maybe. This is the story of Hunt for the Infinite Scroll.</p>

        <blockquote>I had this 'I am dead' idea on a whim, and let's see what happens now.</blockquote>

        <p>I heard about the Infinite Scroll when I was just out of primary school. My friend Charlotte told me about her parents finding this abandoned cave near the lake by our school, when they were younger. I was so intrigued I thought I'd take some time to go explore the cave myself. Turns out I was going to end up seriously injured.</p>

        <blockquote>I am randommly coming up with these names and places. I don't particularly have a plan going into this but I am having fun, and that's all that matters.</blockquote>

        <p>My name is Joss. I was 14 when I decided to explor the cave. This cave was near the Nickel Creek, the creek where supposedly the recipie for the famous Timmy's Hot Ham and Cheese was found washed up.</p>

        <blockquote>Joss came out of a name generating website, and Nickel Creek is a band that I'm currently listening too. They're pretty good live:<a href="https://youtu.be/jFycqnOpifQ" target="_blank">NPR Tiny Desk Concert Link</a></blockquote>

        <p>Why was a Hot Ham and Cheese famous, and why did it need a recipe, I will never know, but it was famous. One time the National News came to our town to film a story on Timmy. My parents went to school with Timmy, they always thought he'd end up famous. They'd always talk about how friendly and popular Timmy was. All the ladies loved him, and he was just perfect.</p>

        <blockquote>I obviously have an idea that Timmy is going to either go bankrupt or cheat on his wife or secretly be something nefarious.</blockquote>

        <p>My life changed when I walked into the cave next to Nickel Creek, one rainy Saturday morning..</p>
